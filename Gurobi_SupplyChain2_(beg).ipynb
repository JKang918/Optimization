    "In this problem, we have six end customers, each with a known demand for a product.  Customer demand can be satisfied from a set of six depots, or directly from a set of two factories.  Each depot can support a maximum volume of product moving through it, and each factory can produce a maximum amount of product.  There are known costs associated with transporting the product, from a factory to a depot, from a depot to a customer, or from a factory directly to a customer. This extension provides the opportunity to choose which four of the six possible depots to open.  It also provides an option of expanding capacity at one specific depot.\n",
